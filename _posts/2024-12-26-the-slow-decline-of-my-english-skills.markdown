<p>As a non-native English speaker, my journey with the language has always been one of persistent improvement, a pursuit of mastery. But ever since the advent of ChatGPT, I’ve noticed something strange happening—I’ve become too reliant on it, and in the process, my own command of the language has slowly deteriorated. It's as if the digital assistant, in its quest to simplify my writing, unintentionally took away the very skills I worked so hard to build.</p>

<p>When I first began learning English, it was a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. I wasn’t just interested in speaking the language; I wanted to think in it, dream in it, and most importantly, master its nuances. In those early days, I would jot down every unfamiliar word, carefully writing definitions and translations, making sure to study them consistently. Flashcards became my best friend, and I took pride in expanding my vocabulary. Each new word I learned felt like a small victory, bringing me closer to fluency—not just at a basic level, but deeply understanding its idiomatic expressions, cultural subtleties, and even its grammar rules. I spent hours reading diverse texts to immerse myself in grammar, not just focusing on syntax, but also on developing a natural feel for the rhythm of the language—when to pause, how to vary sentence structure, and how to create a flow that would make my writing engaging.</p>

<p>Enter ChatGPT—an innovation that would change everything. I remember the first time I used it, skeptically typing a sentence riddled with errors. I didn’t expect much, just a quick fix. But when the response came back, not only had ChatGPT corrected my mistakes, it had rewritten the entire sentence in a way that sounded more polished and professional. It felt like magic. Gone were the days when I had to meticulously review grammar guides or check my work repeatedly. I was hooked.  </p>

<p>At first, it seemed like a blessing—no more worrying about whether my tenses were correct or if my sentence structure was awkward. With ChatGPT, all I had to do was type, and the model would quickly suggest edits, improving my writing instantly. As someone who had painstakingly studied English for years, this sudden shift felt like a revelation. I could focus on expressing my ideas without worrying about minor errors. But little did I know, this convenience would come at a cost.</p>

<p>As I continued to rely on ChatGPT for quick fixes, my approach to language began to shift. Writing, once a challenging but rewarding exercise, started to feel too effortless. The need to recall new words, form sentences from scratch, and engage deeply with grammar faded into the background. I wasn’t writing as much on my own anymore; I would draft something and then hand it over to ChatGPT for refinement. With each correction, I became more detached from the process of crafting the language myself. This over-reliance made me outsource my English skills to a machine. My vocabulary stagnated; the thrill of discovering new words faded. The deeper connections I once had with grammar—the nuances of sentence structure and tone—became less important because ChatGPT was there to tidy it all up in an instant.</p>

<p>Ironically, this very article you’re reading right now was written with the assistance of ChatGPT. It’s a clear example of how easy it is to slip into the comfort of relying on technology rather than honing one’s own skills. While tools like ChatGPT can be incredibly helpful—especially for language learners who might benefit from immediate feedback or when working to overcome language barriers—they also run the risk of creating dependency. The more I leaned on it, the less I trusted my own abilities.</p>

<p>However, I'm actively working to reclaim my voice. I’ve realized that the only way to rebuild my skills is to re-engage with the language on a deeper level. I’ve set a clear plan in motion: no more mindlessly relying on ChatGPT for every draft. I’m challenging myself to write more from scratch, allowing my thoughts to flow naturally, and only using the tool for occasional assistance when absolutely necessary. I’m reading with greater intention, not just to study grammar and vocabulary, but to immerse myself in the language’s deeper aspects—its tone, style, and voice. </p>

<p>Every day, I push myself to interact with English on a more conscious level. When I come across a word I don’t know, I write it down, look it up, and integrate it into my vocabulary. I read articles and books that stretch my comprehension, and I write in journals, crafting essays, and even attempting creative pieces. Each of these exercises helps me regain the fluidity I once had with the language. Though I still turn to ChatGPT for occasional grammar checks, it’s no longer the crutch it once was. Now, I see it as a reminder of the journey I’ve taken and a tool I can use sparingly.</p>

<p>The process isn’t fast, and it’s not always easy. But I’m committed to rebuilding my relationship with English. With every word I engage with, every sentence I write from scratch, I feel my confidence growing. I’m learning to trust myself again, to find my voice without relying on instant fixes. The journey continues, and with it, my commitment to truly mastering the language—not just as a tool for communication, but as a space for expression and creativity.</p>

<p>I have written this article with the intention of sharing my journey and the lessons I’ve learned. But as I reflect on my experience with language, I've realized that over-reliance on ChatGPT for writing could extend beyond language—it could affect my work, too. For example, I might lean on it to solve programming problems at work, which could hinder my growth as a developer. Relying too much on instant solutions could prevent me from truly mastering coding skills and problem-solving. It’s a reminder to stay mindful of how easy it is to become dependent on technology, not just in my passions, but in my professional life as well.</p>

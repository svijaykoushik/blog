  <strong><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Note to Readers:</strong> This article was originally written in May 2017 and references an event from February 20, 2017. The information may reflect the state of cybersecurity and domain usage at that time.
</div>

<p>In a significant move to bolster cybersecurity, the State Bank of India (<abbr title="State Bank of India">SBI</abbr>) rebranded its website from <code>https://www.sbi.co.in</code> to <code>https://www.bank.sbi</code> using a generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD). This makes SBI the first Indian bank to implement its own gTLD, aimed at protecting customers from phishing scams.</p>

<h2>What is a gTLD?</h2>
<p>A generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD) is the part of a domain name that appears at the end, such as <code>.com</code> or <code>.org.</code> These domains are categorized for specific purposes, such as commercial (<code>.com</code>), organizational (<code>.org</code>), or educational (<code>.edu</code>). However, the unrestricted use of traditional gTLDs has made them vulnerable to misuse in phishing attacks.</p>

<h2>The Role of gTLDs in Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>Phishing attacks often exploit the similarity of URLs to deceive users into revealing sensitive information. A scammer might create a fraudulent website resembling the bank’s official site to trick users into providing their credentials. This is where SBI's new gTLD, .sbi, offers a robust solution:
	<dl>
		<dt>Exclusive Use:</dt>
		<dd>The <code>.sbi</code> domain is restricted solely to SBI, ensuring that any website or email ending with <code>.sbi</code> is legitimately affiliated with the bank. This makes it easier for customers to verify the authenticity of communications.</dd>
		<dt>Enhanced Trust:</dt>
		<dd>Customers can confidently interact with SBI online knowing that any link with <code>.sbi</code> is genuine, thus reducing the risk of falling victim to phishing.</dd>
	</dl>
</p>
<h2>Understanding Phishing</h2>
<p>
	Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity. This often involves emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources, tricking users into clicking links and submitting personal information on fake websites.
</p>
<p>Here’s a basic example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A user receives an email claiming they have won a large sum of money and are asked to provide personal details or make a small payment to claim the prize. This type of scam can be mitigated by checking the sender’s email and the URL of any included links.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preventive Measures</h3>
<p>To protect against phishing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Email Verification:</b> Always check the sender's email address for authenticity.</li>
<li><b>URL Inspection:</b> Verify the URL in the browser’s address bar to ensure it matches the official site’s domain.</li>
<li><b>Test Credentials:</b> On suspicious sites, inputting incorrect credentials can reveal fraudulent attempts if no error message is received.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SBI's gTLD Initiative</h2>
<p>The introduction of <code>https://www.bank.sbi</code> marks a significant step towards securing online banking. This restricted gTLD ensures that customers can easily identify genuine SBI communications and websites. SBI plans to extend this gTLD to its other services, further enhancing online security for its customers.</p>

<h2>A Quick Guide to Common gTLDs</h2>
<p>Below is a list of some common gTLDs and their intended purposes:</p>
<table>

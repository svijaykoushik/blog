<p>Though we cursed it's changes in policies relating to savings banks account, India's biggest public sector bank State Bank Of India has given its website a new avatar to protect its customers from phishing scams.<br/>Yes, I'm talking about the recent news about <abbr title="State Bank of India">SBI</abbr> rebranding its website with its own highest domain protocol known as the generic Top Level Domain (gTLD) to <code>https://www.bank.sbi</code> from <code>https://www.sbi.co.in</code>. <abbr title="State Bank of India">SBI</abbr> is the first banking company to have its own <abbr title="generic Top Level Domain">gTLD</abbr>.</p>

<p>What is a <abbr title="generic Top Level Domain">gTLD</abbr>? and What does it have to do with protection against phishing? Well, a gTLD is the last label of a fully qualified domain name. A fully qualified domain name is the complete address of a website like <code>www.google.com</code> or <code>www.wikipedia.org</code>. The labels <q>.com</q> and <q>.org</q> are the top level domains. These top level domains are called generic for historic reasons to differentiate different domains that existed during the development of internet. But hold on a second! If they are called top level domains then why are they at the last? The reason is, the Domain Name System or <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> in short, the directory service responsible for identifying the correct website corresponding to a particular domain name organises the domain names from right to left in a hierarchical order. Thus the label in the far right goes in the top of the hierarchy and the label in the far left goes in the bottom of the hierarchy.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Illustration of DNS hierarchy with gTLDs</span>
<p>The gTlDs were created to represent a particular purpose, like <em>com</em> for commercial entities, <em>net</em> for network infrastructures and <em>edu</em> for educational use. But, because of the lack of restriction the entities <em>com, net and org</em> are now open to use for any purpose despite their original specific goals and hence these <abbr title="Top Level Domains">TLDs</abbr> are designated as <em>unrestricted</em>. There are other <abbr title="Top Level Domains">TLDs</abbr> like <em>biz, name and pro</em> are considered generic but are designated as restricted because registrations with them require <em>proof of eligibility</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>sbi</em> <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr> is also designated as restricted. Meaning no other individual or organization is allowed to register under the sbi domain. So, how does this secure us, the customers from phishing scams? To know this, I'll tell you about phishing first. according to Wikipedia:
<blockquote>Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.</blockquote>
The traditional phishing involves the scammer sending an email informing that the user has won a $10 billion in a lottery that the user never even heard of and requesting the user to send a stipulated amount to a particular account as processing fee to avail the prize money which the user never receives if he/she transfers the said processing fee. This being said the scammers lure internet users with a fake mail that is disguised as an official mail from the bank asking the credentials of the users for security purposes or any other purpose that convinces the user to click on the links in the mail. When clicked these links open a fraudent website that is designed exactly like the banks website. These fraudent sites capture user credentials when submitted and save them in the scammer's computer which he/she uses it to steal the user's money.
</p>
<p>The first scam can be averted by adding the sender's mail address to the spam list of the user's email service provider (Even though email service providers like Google and yahoo provide automatic spamming features some spam mail's escape their spam filters). and the second can be fended off by verifying whether the sender's mail address is the bank's official address (the sender's address might have the wrong spelling). and by checking the addresses on the address bar of the browser and verify if it is the bank's official website (check for wrong spelling). Another possible method to check a suspicious website is to willingly provide wrong credentials. If the site does not respond an error then it is a fraudent site.</p>

<p>Since the gTLD <em>sbi</em> is restricted only to sbi, one can easily differentiate between fraudent and the original websites and e-mails because the official email addresses and website will end with <em><q>.sbi</q></em>. So far only the bank's website has this new gTLD and the bank's officials have announced that other businesses of <abbr title="State Bank of India">SBI</abbr> like insurance will get their own gTLD. The officials also said that the bank's previous web address <code>www.sbi.co.in</code> continue to exist as long as the customers get accustomed to the new web address <code>www.bank.sbi</code>.</p>

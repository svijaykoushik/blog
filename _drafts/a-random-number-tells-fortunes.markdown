Hello, world!

I wanna tell you about an old web app I made during my internship with my previous employer. I found it buried deep inside the directory tree while I was looking for something else. The app responds to user's queries from a list of preprogrammed replies in a random fashion like those weighing machines that prints random fortunes behind the card that tells your weight. I did this as part of an assignment on using DOM methods to parse and XML file.

The app worked like this

```PseudoCode
WHEN the user presses 'enter key' DO
    READ the query
    IF query is NOT empty
        LOAD the xml from the server
        PARSE the file to extract the responses
        SELECT a random response from the list
        DISPLAY it to the user
    ELSE
        do nothing
END
```

While my fellow interns made professional looking programs that displayed information in neatly coloured tables, I made this app because I thought it was cool. But, it was not! the examiner didn't even bat an eye when I demoed the app :(. May be that's why I buried it deep in the directory tree. Anyway, As I was looking at the code a question popped in my head "How does `Math.random()` work?". I was intrigued. So, I googled about it and boy! I was in for a shocking surprise.

## Pseudo Random Number Generator

JavaScript generates random numbers using an algorithm called a random number generator and

Said  [johnny](https://stackoverflow.com/users/28045/johnny) in a [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43210642/is-typescripts-purpose-to-be-used-for-manipulating-the-dom-like-javascript-is) on stackoverflow.com. A while back I had the same question. Can We Use Typescript to manipulate the DOM?

Hello world!

I‚Äôve been learning Typescript for a week now. I got into typescript when I wanted to learn the new Angular. Since it is based on Typescript, I decided to learn Typescript. With that decision I started out with tutorials from [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/typescript/) and [Learn TypeScript in 50 Minutes](https://youtu.be/WBPrJSw7yQA) from [Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/Codevolution). I got to know the basics and what's available in the language. Then I started reading the book *Programming Typescript by Boris Cherny* to learn more about the details in the language as suggested by [Ivan Petrov](https://dev.to/tinmanjk) in a comment on my [previous post](https://dev.to/svijaykoushik/stop-tracking-and-start-ignoring-ook) on dev.to. Thanks, Ivan! üëçüèΩ. During the course of learning, I found it odd that none of the learning aids I used included examples of using the language with HTML. Every example I saw in those learning aids and some other tutorials I then looked up involved only node.js. More googling landed me on stackoverflow where johnny like I mentioned before had the same question. Thankfully the answers there pointed out that I can use it for html or else I would‚Äôve been pissed. I also found that the solutions regarding DOM manipulation were scattered across the internet. So, I decided to make this post to combine all these and present it in a coherent way so you won‚Äôt have to waste a lot of time like me.

## Configuration

TypeScript has out of the box support for different types required for basic programming needs. But to use the DOM, I needed to configure the typescript compiler to include the *‚Äúdom‚Äù* library in the compiler options section of the configuration file<sup>\[[2](#References)\]</sup>. Did the creators do that on purpose? Why didn‚Äôt they include by default? I thought. May be the creators didn't intend to use it this way.

Some other configuration changes I made were: I enabled strict mode for strict type checking and I changed the target from common JS to es5, so the compiler can output JS for browsers and not for node.js. I also added *"es2015"* library so that I could use functionalities like arrays and Math functions.

```javascript
/**
* tsconfig.json
* Configuration file in the project folder for the Typescript compiler
*/
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "lib": [
            "es2015",
            "dom"
        ],
        "strict": true,
        "target": "es2015"
    }
}
```

## Hello world

In this article, I‚Äôm going to write a hello world program to demonstrate the use of DOM in typescript. Because, it‚Äôs my first post on typescript. I‚Äôll be covering:

1. Creating Elements.

2. Attaching elements to DOM.

3. Accessing a particular element in DOM.

4. Changing the element‚Äôs style.

5. Changing the element‚Äôs text value and.

6. Adding CSS classes to elements.

I‚Äôm not covering DOM events here. I‚Äôll be covering them in another article coming soon.

First, I‚Äôll cover the basic example of changing the inner text value of an existing element. I started by creating a html file with a simple html5 boiler plate with a `<h1>` element with id greeter saying ‚Äúhello‚Äù inside the body.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Hello world</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="greeter">Hello</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Then, I opened a new typescript file and added the following code

``` typescript

let greeter:HTMLHeadingElement = document.getElementById("greeter");

greeter.innerText = "Hello world!";

 ```

![Typescript type declaration]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ts-dom/ts-type-declaration.jpg)

In the code, I created a variable greeter and I assigned the type `HTMLHeadingElement`  to it. The `HTMLHeadingElement` type which is defined in the ‚Äúdom‚Äù library we added to the configuration, tells the compiler that the greeter variable expects a html heading element and nothing else. And, I assigned the greeter to the value returned by the function `getElementById`  which returns the element with the ID provided. Then I assigned the string ‚Äúhello world‚Äù to the `innerText` property of the greeter element.

When I compiled the code with the command

``` cmd
:> tsc script.js
```

![Typescript type declaration]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ts-dom/ts-compile-command.jpg)

It threw the following error

> Type 'HTMLElement | null' is not assignable to type 'HTMLHeadingElement'.
>
> Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'HTMLHeadingElement'.

Bummer! My first attempt failed. On the bright side, Typescript is doing its job and the configurations I set up works. The error means that, I tried to assign greeter which is of type `HTMLHeadingElement` with an object of type `HTMLElement` that the method `getElementById` returned. `HTMLElement | null` in the error message means that the method‚Äôs return value can be either of type `HTMLElement` or `null`. The special operator `|` is called the union operator. I won‚Äôt be explaining about union types in this article. You can learn about them [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#union-types).

`HTMLElement` type is just a common interface for all the html elements<sup>\[[1](#References)\]</sup> but the compiler expects a `HTMLHeadingElement`. I thought of changing the greeter variable‚Äôs type to `HTMLElement` but I didn‚Äôt. Because, it‚Äôs not right. If I had changed it to `HTMLElement`, it means greeter could accept any HTML element from the DOM. I wanted it to accept only a heading element. So, I used *type assertion* feature of typescript (Learn about type assertion [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#type-assertions)) to tell the compiler that the element returned from the getElementById is indeed a heading element and it doesn‚Äôt have to worry about it. Here's the fixed code:

``` typescript
let greeter:HTMLHeadingElement = document.getElementById("greeter") as HTMLHeadingElement;

greeter.innerText = "Hello world!";
```

![Typescript type declaration]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ts-dom/ts-type-assertion.jpg)

Now, the compilation was a success. I included the script.js file generated by the compiler in the html document and opened it on a browser. It looked like this:

![Typescript type declaration]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ts-dom/ts-screenshot-no-style.png)

### Decoration time

Everything worked great and as planned. It was time to decorate the page. I wanted a font style that is not formal looking. After browsing through google fonts, I liked *Rock Salt*. I imported it in my stylesheet along with *Dancing Script* as a secondary font. I then proceeded with modifying the html document by adding few more elements. I centered everything using flex box, added a nice background from [UI gradients](https://uigradients.com/#CanYouFeelTheLoveTonight)., and made some position adjustments to arrange the elements properly. The page now looked like this:

![Typescript type declaration]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ts-dom/ts-screenshot-bg-and-font.png)

I wanted to add a pretty background animation of orbs rising to the top like bubbles to the page. To make the orbs I decided to use `<div>` elements. Since I wanted several of these orbs with different sizes, I split the task into two so the work could be simplified. One, I created a common style for all the orbs and created a custom animation for the orbs in CSS. And two, I created the orbs dynamically with the help of typescript by creating a set number of `<div>` elements, assigning them the style created beforehand and randomizing their sizes, positions and animation delay to make them look more natural.

```javascript
.
.
.
function createBubbles() {

    for (let i = 0; i < bubbleCount; i++) {

        let div: HTMLDivElement = document.createElement("div") as HTMLDivElement;

        let divSize = getSize();

        div.style.left = getLeftPosition() + "px";

        div.style.width = divSize + "px";

        div.style.height = divSize + "px";

        div.style.animationDelay = i * randomFloat(0, 30) + "s";

        div.style.filter = "blur(" + randomFloat(2, 5) + "px)";

        div.classList.add("bubble");

        bubbleBuffer.push(div);

    }

    console.log("Bubbles created");

}
.
.
.
```

Finally, I added the orbs to the dom like this and thereby kickstarting the animation

```javascript
.
.
.
function releaseBubbles() {

    createBubbles();

    for (let i = 0; i < bubbleCount; i++) {

        containerDiv.appendChild(bubbleBuffer[i]);

    }

    console.log("Bubbles released");

}
.
.
.
```

Here‚Äôs the final output

## Conclusion

During the course of writing this article and the example, I realized the involvement of advanced concepts like type assertion and union types. I now understand why the authors of those tutorials didn't include them. If included, it would have confused beginners outright. I think it‚Äôs best to learn typescript well before starting to use DOM in your projects.

In my example I skipped the null checking when I fixed the type mismatch error as it seemed unnecessary for the example but you should check for nulls when necessary to avoid breaking your app at runtime. I also skipped the part where I added animations using the animate.css plugin for the text as it felt trivial explaining it.

Thanks for your time. :)

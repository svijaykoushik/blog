Hello world!

I'll be showing you an app that I built when I did my internship with my previous employer. During my internship I was tasked to create a JavaScript program that reads an XML file, parses it and displays the data on a HTML page in whatever format that I desired. After thinking for a while, I decided to make a fortune telling app. The reason is that I love this site https://askhelixfossil.com that I found a few months before my internship. It's funny replies for my queries attracted me.

As a curious developer, I wanted to know how it worked. So, I rignt-clicked and chose view-source and borwsed through the source code. The working is very simple! They have an array of responses from which one is chosen randomly with the help of `Math.random()`.

Now that I know how it works, I started making my own. I put all my responses in an XML file and then I read it back. The program worked like this.
```
START
READ the xml file ASYNC
PARSE the file and EXTRACT the responses using dom functions.
STORE all the responses in an array.
ACCEPT the query from the user.
randomly CHOOSE a response from the array.
DISPLAY it to the user.
END
```

Hello, world!

How does JavaScript generate random numbers? This popped when I was looking through some of my old code one day. I was intrigued and I googled about it. Well, JavaScript and other programming languages use something called a **Random Number Generator** to generate random numbers. A Random number generator is a device that generates sequences random numbers like a set of dice that you throw while playing board games like Snakes and Ladders or Business (Monopoly). But, computers are too dumb to generate their own random sequence of numbers like a dice throw. So, clever programmers used math to simulate the generation of random numbers. I said "simulate" because, these methods of generation actually reveal a pattern when used for sufficiently longer periods of time.

## Pseudo Random Generators

Programmers have developed more than 25 different ways to use math to imitate the generation of unpredictable sequence numbers over the past 8 decades. Hence these different ways or algorithms as I'll call here after are aptly called Pseudo Random Number Generator algorithms. Because, they are fake and are completely predictable.

## How do they work?
